The code for the Gaussian experiments is based on https://github.com/poolio/unrolled_gan but modified to reflect the parameters specified in the Unrolled GANs paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02163">arxiv:1611.02163</a>. The experiments for our paper were performed on Tensorflow 1.1.0 and Keras 1.2.
